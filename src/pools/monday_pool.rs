// Monday Trade is a V3-style AMM (inspired by Uniswap V3 with tick-based architecture)
// It uses slot0() interface, same as Uniswap V3 and PancakeSwap V3
// See: https://docs.monday.trade/spot-trading/spot-protocol-mechanics/how-the-amm-+-order-book-model-works
//
// This module is kept for documentation purposes.
// Use create_slot0_call() from v3_pool.rs for Monday Trade pools.
